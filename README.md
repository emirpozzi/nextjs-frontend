I have completed what I prioritized and I could do in 4 hours then stopped. My next step would have been to implement the carousel using an external library such as [react-carousel](https://github.com/brainhubeu/react-carousel) for mobile screen sizes, but I tried anyways to have an adaptive design so that is still looks nice on mobile with vertical images.

Limitations:
I am not used to Typescript in React so I wasn't sure how to type components and props, hence there are some type errors in console. I use Typescript in Angular so I am used to the language, just not in React at the moment.
